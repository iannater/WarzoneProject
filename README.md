# Ian's Warzone Project

## Description 
The goal here is to build a site that allows people to input their gamer tag as well as tags of friends. When they search for that tag we will do an API call and populate a table with stats based on their return. We will then save that info to local storage so that they can compare their stats against friends as they continue to search. 

### User Story
AS a Warzone player, I want to see my teams stats in one place, so that I can stay up to date without having to be on my system.
